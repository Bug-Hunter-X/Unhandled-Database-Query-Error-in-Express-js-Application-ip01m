# Unhandled Database Query Error in Express.js Application

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: improper error handling in database queries.  Failure to correctly handle errors can lead to application crashes and inconsistencies.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application that performs a database query. However, it lacks robust error handling. If the database query fails, the application will either crash or return an incomplete response, leading to unexpected behavior.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code with improved error handling. It includes comprehensive checks for errors and provides appropriate responses, making the application more robust and reliable.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install express pg` (assuming you are using PostgreSQL; adapt as needed for other databases). 
4. Configure your database connection details. 
5. Run the buggy code using `node bug.js` to observe the error.
6. Run the fixed code using `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected behavior.
